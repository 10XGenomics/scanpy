  We reproduce most of the `Guided Clustering tutorial`_ of Seurat_ [Satija15]_.

  Analyzing 68 000 cells from [Zheng17]_, we find that Scanpy is about a factor 5 to 16 faster and more memory efficient than the `Cell Ranger`_ R kit for secondary analysis.

  We reproduce the results of the Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT) paper of [Haghverdi16]_. Note that DPT has recently been very `favorably discussed`_ by the authors of Monocle_.
