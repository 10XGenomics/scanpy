Getting started
---------------

With Python 3.5 or 3.6 installed, get `releases on PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scanpy>`__ via (consider using ``pip3`` to access Python 3, more information on installation :doc:`here <installation>`)::

  pip install scanpy

To work with the latest version on `GitHub <https://github.com/theislab/scanpy>`__: clone the repository – green button on top of the page – and ``cd`` into its root directory and type::

    pip install -e .

You can now ``import scanpy.api as sc`` anywhere on your system and work with the command ``scanpy`` on the command-line.
